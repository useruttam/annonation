Arugument by Petitioner:
34. We have heard Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsel and Ms. Anshula Grover, learned counsel for appellants; Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General, Mr. Arun R. Pedneker, learned Standing Counsel for the State of Goa and Ms. Mukti Chowdhary, learned counsel for the Authority; and Mr. Vinay Navare, learned senior counsel and Mr. R.P. Gupta, learned counsel for respondent No. 1.

Argument by Respondent:
41. For elaborating this grievance of the appellants, we must advert to the bye-laws of the Society under which the appellants had submitted application(s) for being admitted as member of the respondent-Society. Bye-law 1(a) postulates that any person irrespective of his race, caste, religion and sex, shall be entitled to be considered for being admitted as member upon complying with the conditions specified therein. The other relevant clause in the bye-laws is clause 1(c), which reads thus:

Issues:
The central question in this appeal is: Whether the invalidation of membership of appellants and the impleaded appellants For short, "the appellants" (and two others), solely on the ground that the then Managing Committee on its way out and facing no confidence motion before the Special General Body Meeting For short, "SGBM" demanded by the majority of existing members of the Society ought not to have hastened admission of new members, is just and proper and the appropriate direction necessary in that regard?
