Statute : 1. These writ petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India seek a declaration that Section 12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 for short, "the 1961 Act", is ultra vires the provisions of Articles 243D and 243T including Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India

Statute : 3. Section 12 of the 1961 Act is reproduced hereunder:


Legislation : 61. In respect of the objections against the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, 1993, all that we can refer to is the Chinnappa Reddy Commission Report (1990) which reflects the position as it existed twenty years ago

Statute : 13. As regards Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act inserted in 1994, the plain language does give an impression that uniform and rigid quantum of 27 per cent of the total seats across the State need to be set apart by way of reservation in favour of OBCs

Statute : 17. Indeed, the exercise of power to reserve seats for OBCs springs from Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act, but that is hedged by conditions and limitations specified by the Constitution Bench of this Court and would not get ignited until such time

Statute : 24. The State Election Commission had invited our attention to the fact that, provision similar to Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act regarding reservation for OBCs finds place in other State enactments (1) The Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959 - Section 10(2)(c)


Statute : (2) Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial Townships Act, 1965 - Sections 9(2)(d) and 341(B)(4)
.

Statute : (3) The Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act, 1949 - Section 5A(1)(c) concerning the establishment of Village Panchayat, Municipal Council, Nagar Panchayat, Corporation, etc.

Statute : 25. In conclusion, we hold that Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act is an enabling provision and needs to be read down to mean that it may be invoked only upon complying with the triple conditions (mentioned in paragraph 12 above) as specified by the Constitution Bench of this Court, before notifying the seats as reserved for OBC category in the concerned local bodies

Statute : 28. The challenge to the validity of Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act is negatived
