Arugument by Petitioner:

Argument by Respondent:
9. Learned counsel for the respondents supported the judgment of the Division Bench and the Full Bench, arguing that on facts, a beneficial legislation which is meant to further religious, charitable and educational purposes should not be construed in a narrow fashion, and should be construed in accordance with the object sought to be achieved, and this being the case, the aforesaid judgments do not require to be disturbed.

Issues:
Can it be said that the letting out at market rent would be connected with religious activity because the rental that is received is ploughed back only into religious activity?
Letting out a building for a commercial purpose would lose any rational connection with religious activity.
