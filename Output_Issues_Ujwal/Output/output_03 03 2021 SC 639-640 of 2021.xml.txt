Arugument by Petitioner:

Argument by Respondent:

Issues:
Undoubtedly, fairness to candidates who participate in the process is an important consideration.
The precedents of this Court sufficiently demonstrate that when the credibility of an entire examination stands vitiated by systemic irregularities, the issue then is not about seeking to identify the candidates who are tainted.
Persons who are recruited are intended to fulfil public functions associated with the functioning of the Government.
