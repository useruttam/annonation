 31.3 Under the existing provisions of section 37(2A) of the Income-tax Act, deduction in respect of expenditure on entertainment is subject to certain limits calculated with reference to the quantum of profits as under:- (at page 2255) In the Income-tax Act, 1961, Chapter IV contains provisions relating to computation of total income wherein Section D containing Sections 28 to 44D pertains to profits and gains of business or profession

 In our opinion, the construction we have made of the provision as it existed during the relevant period flows not merely from the language of the provision but also matches with the object thereof. It means that the expenditure incurred by the assessees in providing ordinary meals to the outstation customers according to the established business practice, was a permissible deduction inspite of sub-section (2A) of Section 37, to which the assessees were entitled in the computation of their total income for the purpose of payment of tax under the Income-tax Act, 1961 during the relevant period prior to 1
