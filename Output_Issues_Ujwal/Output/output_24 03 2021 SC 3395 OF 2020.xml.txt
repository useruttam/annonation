Arugument by Petitioner:
46. Another major part of objections, in terms of magnitude and implication, came up from the dissenting financial creditor ICICI Bank. It was submitted by this lender bank that being a dissenting financial creditor, it was entitled to receive payment as per the liquidation value in terms of Section 30(2)(b) of the Code read with Regulation 38(1)(b) of CIRP Regulations but in the resolution plan, it was sought to be provided only the land and equity in the SPVs proposed to be incorporated; and such a provision in the resolution plan was entirely impermissible. It was also submitted that while the assenting financial creditors were allowed to receive upfront payment of INR 300 crores on the basis of fresh debts raised by Expressway but the same benefit was not being extended to the dissenting financial creditors. The NCLT noted the star argument of the learned counsel for ICICI Bank that distribution of equity or the land parcels to the dissenting financial creditors does not satisfy the requirement of "payment" under Section 30(2) of the Code read with Regulation 38(1)(b) of the CIRP Regulations; and such payment has to be a liquidated sum, as stated under Section 53 of the Code. Per contra, it was contended on behalf of the resolution applicant and the IRP that it was nowhere envisaged in Section 30(2) of the Code that payment of liquidation value to dissenting financial creditors has to be in cash; that even Regulation 38(1)(b) of the CIRP Regulations only provided for the priority of payment to the dissenting financial creditors before the assenting financial creditors and the mode of payment to be in cash was not mentioned; that when the assenting financial creditors were not being paid in cash and had accepted equity and land parcels, payment to the dissenting financial creditors in cash would cause prejudice to the rights of the assenting financial creditors. Meaning of the word "payment" in Black's Law Dictionary was also cited and it was argued that the money or other valuable thing delivered to discharge the obligation is to be construed as payment under Section 30(2) of the Code.

Argument by Respondent:

E. As to whether the Adjudicating Authority has erred in modifying the step provided in the resolution plan in regard to the fixed deposit holders and in directing the resolution applicant to make provision towards the dues of unclaimed fixed deposit holders also?

H. As to whether the minority shareholders are entitled to state their claims/objections despite having not approached the Adjudicating Authority; and as to whether the resolution plan does not provide fair treatment to the minority shareholders?
I. (i) As to whether, after approval of the resolution plan of NBCC by the Committee of Creditors, where homebuyers as a class assented to the plan, any individual homebuyer or any association of homebuyers could maintain a challenge to the resolution plan and could be treated as a dissenting financial creditor or an aggrieved person?
(ii) As to whether the stipulations in the resolution plan stand in violation of the provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016?
(iii) As to whether the resolution plan is violative of the requirements of CIRP Regulations?
(iv) As to whether any housing project which has been completed or is nearing completion ought to be kept out of the purview of the resolution plan?
J. (i) As to whether the amount of INR 750 crores, which was deposited by JAL pursuant to the orders passed by this Court in the case of Chitra Sharma, and accrued interest thereupon, is the property of JAL and stipulation in the resolution plan concerning its usage by JIL or NBCC is impermissible?
(ii) As to whether any amount is receivable by JIL and/or its homebuyers from JAL; and the accounts between JAL and JIL need reconciliation?

M. As to whether the Appellate Authority was justified in providing for an Interim Monitoring Committee for implementation of the resolution plan in question during the pendency of appeals?
N. What should be the final order and relief?
These appeals raised essentially two issues before this Court: one, as to whether NCLT or NCLAT had the power to exclude any period from the statutory period in exercise of inherent powers sans any express provision in the Code in that regard; and second, whether it was open to allow the bidder whose resolution plan had already been rejected by CoC, to submit revised plan or to invite fresh resolution plans to be considered by CoC after the statutory period specified for submission of such plans?
This is how the process of approval of resolution plan culminated in the impugned order dated 03.
After examining the long length of rival submissions, this Court proceeded to determine the questions as to whether the percentage of voting share of the financial creditors specified in Section 30(4) of IBC was mandatory; as to whether the votes of the financial creditors who had abstained from voting were required to be ignored for the purpose of computing the required percentage of voting share; as to whether the amendments brought into force during the pendency of appeals were applicable to those cases; and as to whether it was open to the Adjudicating Authority/Appellate Authority to reckon any factor other than those specified in Sections 30(2) or 61(3) of IBC, as the case may be, for rejection of the resolution plan?
Having examined the objection against simultaneous voting with reference to the material on record and the law applicable, we are unable to find any substance whatsoever in this objection.
1 is removed from the CA, a serious question would arise as to how the rights and obligations of the substituted concessionaire JIL could at all be transferred to another SPV?
1 has to be applied for creation of any SPV by or on behalf of JIL.
In the second part of Step 6B, specific stipulations are contained as regards the dissenting financial creditors.
1 crores which is 1.
The question is as to what is intended by these provisions and as to how the action of "payment" is to be performed?
The question is as to whether the Adjudicating Authority could have done so?
The other set of objectors is of the non-promoter shareholders of the corporate debtor, who are also referred to as the minority shareholders.
With reference to the condition precedent mentioned in the resolution plan involving the transfer of INR 750 crores in favour of NBCC, it is submitted that the question requiring consideration is as to whether NBCC could have laid a claim over the said sum of INR 750 crores as a condition of its bid?
2020 placing the said amount of INR 750 crores and accrued interest in the asset pool of JIL is unsustainable, the question is as to what orders in sequel be made regarding this money?
(ii) The question as to whether any amount is receivable by JIL and/or its homebuyers from JAL, against advance towards construction and with reference to the admitted liability to the tune of INR 195 crores as on 31.
