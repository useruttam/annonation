Arugument by Petitioner:

Argument by Respondent:

Issues:
'(i) Whether the court while adjudicating upon the dispute must go to the route of the case and unearth the evil design by lifting the veil ?
(ii) Whether the first appellate court, before setting aside a judgment passed by the learned trial court, is required to analyse the reasons given by the learned trial court and after critical appraisal thereof give its own reasons while disagreeing or setting aside the reasons given by the learned trial court ?
4, "whether the defendant is a tenant" ?
The tenancy is a relationship which is created between two parties.
