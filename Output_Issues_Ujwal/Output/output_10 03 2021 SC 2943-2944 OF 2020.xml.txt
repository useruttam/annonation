Arugument by Petitioner:
26. Learned Senior Counsel submitted, that in this background KIAL was justified in invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution inasmuch as, the proceedings conducted by NCLT were totally in breach of the principles of natural justice, as the matter was heard by a single Member whereas, the orders were passed by the Division Bench. Learned counsel submitted, that the High Court while dismissing the writ petition and relegating KIAL to alternate remedy available in law has passed an elaborate order. Learned Senior Counsel therefore submitted, that it does not lie in the mouth of the appellants, that KIAL had not approached the High Court bona fide. Learned Senior Counsel submitted, that in view of various judgments delivered by this Court, the High Court could have entertained a petition under Article 226, when the proceedings were conducted in breach of the principles of natural justice.
34. Insofar as the judgment of NCLAT in the case of Binani Industries Limited vs. Bank of Baroda & Anr. 2018 SCC Online NCLAT 565 is concerned, learned counsel submitted, that the said judgment is totally distinguishable inasmuch as, in the said case both applicants had submitted their plans and revised plans within the stipulated period.
75. Similarly, reliance placed by the learned counsel for the appellants on the judgment of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise vs. Hongo India Private Limited and another (2009) 5 SCC 791, would also not help the appellants inasmuch as, the question, that fell for consideration there was, with regard to the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act to a reference application provided under Section 35-H(1) of the unamended Central Excise Act, 1944.

Argument by Respondent:
On the said date i.e. 9.7.2018, analogously, the first Form 'G' also came to be notified. Vide the said Form 'G', the last date prescribed for submission of Resolution Plan was on or before 21.9.2018. The second Form 'G' came to be issued on 24.8.2018, which required the Resolution Plans to be submitted on or before 28.9.2018. The third Form 'G' came to be issued on 28.9.2018, which required the Resolution Plans to be submitted on or before 25.10.2018. The fourth Form 'G' came to be issued on 9.11.2018, which required the Resolution Plans to be submitted on or before 13.12.2018. The fifth and the last Form 'G' came to be issued on 11.12.2018, which required the Resolution Plans to be submitted on or before 8.1.2019. KIAL, the appellant before NCLAT (respondent No.1 herein) and one Karvy Data Management Systems Limited submitted their Resolution Plans on the last date as stipulated in the last and fifth Form 'G' i.e. on 8.1.2019.
68. The Civil Judge (Senior Division), Ramanagaram passed an order directing return of the suit records for presentation before the proper court. The respondents therefore collected the papers from the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Ramanagaram and presented the same in the Court of the Principal District Judge, Bangalore (Rural). The District Court framed a preliminary issue, as to whether the suit was barred by the limitation under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. The District Judge held, the application for setting aside the award to be time-barred. The respondents invoked the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore. The Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court held, that the District Judge, Bangalore had committed an error in holding, that Section 14 of the Limitation Act was not applicable to an application submitted under Section 34 of the Act. It was therefore held, that the time taken during which the respondents had been prosecuting in the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Ramanagaram was excludable.

Issues:
(i) Whether the appeals filed by KIAL before NCLAT were within limitation?
(ii) Whether there was waiver and acquiescence by KIAL, so as to estop it from challenging the participation of Kalpraj?
(iii) Whether NCLAT was right in law in interfering with the decision of CoC of accepting the resolution plan of Kalpraj?
(i) WHETHER THE APPEALS FILED BY KIAL BEFORE NCLAT WERE WITHIN LIMITATION?
The question as to whether the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act would also be applicable to the quasi-judicial forums as against the court, fell for consideration before this Court in the case of M.P. Steel Corporation (supra).
(ii) WHETHER THERE WAS WAIVER AND ACQUIESCENCE BY KIAL SO AS TO ESTOP IT FROM CHALLENGING THE PARTICIPATION OF KALPRAJ?
(iii) WHETHER NCLAT WAS RIGHT IN LAW IN INTERFERING WITH THE DECISION OF COC OF ACCEPTING THE RESOLUTION PLAN OF KALPRAJ?
This Court held, that what is left to the majority decision of CoC is the "feasibility and viability" of a resolution plan, which is required to take into account all aspects of the plan, including the manner of distribution of funds among the various classes of creditors.
It has been held, that what is important is, the commercial wisdom of the majority of creditors, which is to determine, through negotiation with the prospective resolution applicant, as to how and in what manner the corporate resolution process is to take place.
