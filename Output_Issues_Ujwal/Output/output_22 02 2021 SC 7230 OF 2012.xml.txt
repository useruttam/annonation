Arugument by Petitioner:
9. It is contended by Sri Himanshu Tyagi, learned counsel for the appellant-Corporation that, though there is no discrimination in fixing the cut-off date, i.e, 05.06.1995, by way of Notification dated 06.10.1995, the High Court has allowed the writ petition, without assigning valid reasons. It is submitted that the employees who retired prior to 05.06.1995, by availing the benefit of Contributory Provident Fund Scheme, constitute a separate class. After availing the benefit of Contributory Provident Fund Scheme, on their retirement, it is not open to plead that Pension Scheme, as notified for the existing employees and the employees retired between 05.06.1995 and 06.10.1995 is discriminatory. The employees who retired prior to 05.06.1995, and the employees presently in service, cannot be treated as a homogeneous class. It is submitted that, it is always open for the employer to extend further benefits to the employees prospectively. When such Scheme is introduced with effect from the date of its approval, i.e, 05.06.1995, same is rightly not extended to the employees who retired prior to 05.06.1995. The Pension Scheme was approved by the Cabinet on 05.06.1995, as such it cannot be said that such a fixation is either arbitrary or illegal.
10. On the other hand, Sri M.C. Dhingra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-applicant, has submitted that there is absolutely no reason or justification for fixing the cut-off date, i.e, 05.06.1995, for implementation of Pension Scheme. It is submitted that all the employees of the Corporation constitute one homogeneous class and the appellant-Corporation should not have made any distinction among such class of employees. It is submitted that, as no valid reasons have been assigned by the appellant-Corporation, for fixing the cut-off date, as such the High Court has rightly allowed the Writ Petition and there are no grounds to interfere with the same. Further submissions of learned counsel for the respondent is that, though the Pension Scheme was notified vide Notification dated 06.10.1995, same was given effect to retrospectively from 05.06.1995, as such there is no reason for not extending such benefit to the employees who retired prior to 05.06.1995 also. With the contentions, as referred above, learned counsel prayed for dismissal of the civil appeal.
