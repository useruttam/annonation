Arugument by Petitioner:
4. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the auction purchaser-appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1845 of 2010 has further submitted that the appeal itself before the High Court challenging the consent decree was not maintainable at all in view of the bar contained in Order XXIII Rule 3 and Section 96(3) CPC. In support of the above submission, he has heavily relied upon the decision of this Court in Pushpa Devi Bhagat v. Rajinder Singh (2006) 5 SCC 566.

Argument by Respondent:
3.3 It is further submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the judgment debtors - original defendants challenged the consent decree dated 01.06.1995 only in the year 2001. It is submitted that in between number of proceedings were initiated before the Executing Court and the orders were passed by the Executing Court dated 03.03.1998, 30.10.1999 and even the mortgaged property was auctioned and the sale certificate was issued in favour of the auction purchaser in the month of November 1999 itself and the judgment debtors-original defendants did not challenge the consent decree on the ground that it was obtained by fraud till 2001. It is submitted therefore that the conduct of the respondents suffers from delay and laches.
4.2 It is further submitted that the High Court has failed to consider the conduct on the part of the judgment debtors-original defendants. It is submitted that even before the High Court a compromise petition was prepared wherein the judgment debtors-original defendants agreed to pay Rs. 6,96,062/- in full and final settlement of the decree passed by the learned Trial Court, however, at the time of the compromise petition, the respondents withdrew from the compromise agreed by them. It is submitted that before the learned Principal City Civil Judge, the judgment debtor-original defendant admitted the said compromise petition and admitted that he put his signature on the compromise petition voluntarily and with free consent. It is submitted that therefore all through-out the conduct on the part of the defendants as original debtor is dis-honest and to delay the proceedings and deprive the auction purchaser from using the property purchased in the year 1999.

Issues:
1999 itself on the day on which the sale was conducted.
