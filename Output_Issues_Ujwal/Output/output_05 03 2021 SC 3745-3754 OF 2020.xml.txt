Arugument by Petitioner:
10. Learned senior counsel for the appellants Shri C. Aryama Sundaram contented that vested right can only be for 69% reservation, while if the view propounded by the respondents was to be taken into account, it would lead to more than 69% reservation. There had been no reduction in reservation below the statutory limit, and that coming in the open category did not mean that they are not entitled to benefit of the reserved category.
14. We may also note the submission of learned senior counsel for the intervenors Mr. S. Nagamuthu, supporting the plea of the appellants because his clients are the beneficiaries of the manner in which the Section is sought to be interpreted by the appellants, and thus certain other reserved categories benefited from the same. The additional submission he made was in the context of Article 16 (4B) of the Constitution of India which reads as under:

Argument by Respondent:
16. On the other hand, learned senior counsel for the respondents Mr. N.L. Rajah contended that the correct methodology was that first, the list has to be drawn up on the basis of merit, and then only the issue of application of reservation would arise.
26. It has been rightly pointed out by learned counsel for the respondents that the issue arising from seniority of filling the backlog vacancies first was not even urged in the courts below and was sought to be raised for the first time before this Court, and elaborately at that, which plea finally fizzled out, as it was conceded that there is no factual basis for the same.

Issues:
We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the courts below as there really could not have been any cavil to the aforesaid.
