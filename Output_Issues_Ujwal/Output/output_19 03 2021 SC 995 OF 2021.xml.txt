Arugument by Petitioner:
4. Shri Sandeep Sudhakar Deshmukh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra (Water Resources Department) ["Govt of Maharashtra"], the appellant in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 665 of 2021, submitted that the Arbitration Act in its original avatar did not include the concept or idea of expeditious resolution of disputes. At best, the Arbitration Act can be treated as a mechanism providing for alternate dispute resolution. This original objective is continued by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 ["2015 Amendment"] which provides a time limit for arbitral awards and for fast track procedure contained in sections 29A and 29B of the Arbitration Act. This being the case, the very foundation of N.V. International (supra) is erroneous in law. Shri Deshmukh also argued that section 37 of the Arbitration Act provides for appeals from several orders, including orders made under sections 8, 9, 16 and 17, apart from orders that may be made under section 34 of the Arbitration Act. According to him, the rationale or logic contained in N.V. International (supra) would perhaps apply only to appeals from section 34 orders, but not to orders that are passed under any of the other aforesaid sections, as there is no hard and fast application of a 120-day limitation period when it comes to applications that have been filed under any of these sections.
11. Shri Manoj Chouhan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of M/s Swastik Wires, the appellant in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.15278 of 2020, supported the impugned judgment dated 27.01.2020 of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh and argued that this Court's judgment in Consolidated Engg. (supra), being a judgment of three learned judges, would prevail over the judgment of this Court in N.V. International (supra), which is only delivered by two learned judges and, therefore, delay can be condoned. He also added that once section 5 of the Limitation Act applies, the Court cannot impose any limits on the expression "sufficient cause" and even if there are long delays and sufficient cause is made out, such delays can be condoned. Further, he argued that this Court could use Article 142 of the Constitution, which is a veritable brahmastra and panacea for all ills, to do justice in individual cases.

Argument by Respondent:
7. Shri Amalpushp Shroti, learned counsel appearing for the respondents in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 15278 of 2020, broadly supported the arguments of Shri Deshmukh and Ms. Bhati, while citing certain other judgments to buttress the same submissions.
12. Dr. Amit George, learned counsel appearing for M/s Associated Construction Co., the respondent in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) Diary No. 18079 of 2020, argued that section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, having regard to the object of speedy disposal sought to be achieved, excludes the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act altogether. For this purpose, he relied heavily upon the judgment of this Court in Kandla Export Corpn (supra) and the judgment of this Court in CCE & Customs v. Hongo India (P) Ltd., (2009) 5 SCC 791 ["Hongo"] which dealt with section 35-H(1) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 ["Central Excise Act"]. He also relied upon other judgments which interpreted section 29(2) of the Limitation Act to state that the scheme of a particular statute may make it clear that there is an "express exclusion" of section 5 of the Limitation Act, which is the case under the Commercial Courts Act. He then relied strongly upon the judgment in N.V. International (supra) by supporting its logic and citing judgments which would show that other sections of the Limitation Act were excluded in the context of section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act - such as sections 4 and 17 of the Limitation Act. In any case, he argued that on facts sufficient cause had not been made out, and that the judgment of the High Court of Delhi dated 15.10.2019 ought to be set aside on this ground also.

Issues:
He also referred to judgments where a casus omissus could be supplied, which is what was done in N.V. International (supra).

(b) to any other court from any decree or order.

We are afraid that we are unable to agree.
