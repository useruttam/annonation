Arugument by Petitioner:
12. It is contended by Ms. V. Mohana, learned senior counsel for the appellants that they had qualified in the Intermediate level at the relevant times in Arts. These appellants also underwent the same syllabus and training as the candidates who had passed Intermediate in Science. She urged that rather than requiring that those qualified for admission to the ANM Course should have qualified Intermediate in Science, the State should have adopted a rational principle such as inter se merit among the candidates, in the completion of the concerned courses. It was urged that that there is no intelligible differentia distinguishing students with Intermediate in Arts and those who have done Intermediate in Science, nor is there any rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The insistence of the science subject amongst two persons falling in the same class, i.e., those who had completed Intermediate, and were registered with the INC, was discriminatory.
18. Other counsel appearing for the appellants urged that some of the appellants had undergone the ANM Course in training institutes in the State of Uttarakhand and others had obtained ANM certificates from different states. It was submitted that the training institutes invited applications and, though the appellants had completed Intermediate in Arts, they were enrolled on the ANM course, which they successfully completed, as they did with the training programme. In these circumstances, the state could not discriminate against them. It was argued that, after having imparted training, these appellants could not be denied appointment.
23. It was argued that the applicability or otherwise of the 2016 Rules was neither pleaded nor urged before the High Court. Learned counsel emphasized that a close reading of the said Rules, especially Rule 8 would show that prior to 2010, the rule position was that to be considered for appointment as ANM, the candidate should have qualified in the concerned course and also graduated with Science in the school board/intermediate. For the brief period between 2010 and 2013, the insistence on qualifying in the science stream was relieved and instead of the 10+2 or intermediate qualification, candidates who had passed the 10th standard with requisite ANM completion certification and training were deemed eligible. In other words, for the three year period up to 2013, a candidate was not required to have qualified in the 12th standard in the science stream. For the period 2013-2016, candidates could apply only if they had an intermediate or equivalent qualification - with science subjects, together with ANM qualification and training. Only with the advent of the 2016 Rules (with effect from 26.07.2016) were those with Intermediate qualification not necessarily with science, but also qualifying in a recognized ANM course with requisite training deemed eligible. It was argued that since none of the petitioners fell in the category of those qualified between 2010-2013, but rather had completed their Intermediate and the relevant ANM course with training prior to 2010 or after 2013, the question of their being eligible did not arise.
